# MS08-067

This module exploits a parsing flaw in the path canonicalization code of NetAPI32.dll through the Server Service. This module is capable of bypassing NX on some operating systems and service packs. The correct target must be used to prevent the Server Service (along with a dozen others in the same process) from crashing. Windows XP targets seem to handle multiple successful exploitation events, but 2003 targets will often crash or hang on subsequent attempts. This is just the first version of this module, full support for NX bypass on 2003, along with other platforms, is still in development.

# MS09-050

This module exploits an out of bounds function table dereference in the SMB request validation code of the SRV2.SYS driver included with Windows Vista, Windows 7 release candidates (not RTM), and Windows 2008 Server prior to R2. Windows Vista without SP1 does not seem affected by this flaw

# ProFTPd IAC 1.3.x - Remote Root Exploit

Multiple stack-based buffer overflows in the pr_netio_telnet_gets function in netio.c in ProFTPD before 1.3.3c allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via vectors involving a TELNET IAC escape character to a (1) FTP or (2) FTPS server.
